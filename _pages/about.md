The ADONIS project investigate asynchronous decentralized optimization for convex and non-convex optimization.
The convex setting allows us to solve mathematically well-posed problems and derive theoretical guarantees about the convergence of an optimization algorithm.
Deep learning is a challenging non-convex setting for optimization, where practical performances can strongly deviates from theoretical predictions.
The ADONIS project thus aims at doing principled research in optimization, driven by practical considerations.
